# Senior-Project
This is my senior project, or my capstone, to complete my Computer Science degree at SUNY Potsdam. 
It will be an encrypted SMS app for Android smartphones. 
It will first use RSA, sending the recipient a public key, 
  which they will then use to send back a 128-bit AES key, 
  which will be used from then on to encrypt/decrypt the actuall communication messages.
